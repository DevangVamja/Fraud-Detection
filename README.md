# Fraud Detection using Neural Network

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Project Description
Fraud detection is a critical task in financial systems to prevent unauthorized transactions and minimize losses. This project uses a dataset of transaction records to build a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The model is trained and evaluated using various techniques, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The data used in this experiment can be found at **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1**

The dataset used in this project contains transaction records with the following features:

- **step**: Represents a unit of time (e.g., hour, day).
- **type**: Type of transaction (e.g., CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER).
- **amount**: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
- **nameOrig**: The name or ID of the customer who initiated the transaction.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: The balance of the origin account before the transaction.
- **newbalanceOrig**: The balance of the origin account after the transaction.
- **nameDest**: The name or ID of the recipient of the transaction.
- **oldbalanceDest**: The balance of the destination account before the transaction.
- **newbalanceDest**: The balance of the destination account after the transaction.
- **isFraud**: A binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether the transaction is fraudulent.
- **isFlaggedFraud**: A binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether the transaction was flagged as fraud by the system.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of transactions being fraudulent.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevangVamja/Fraud-Detection
   cd Fraud-Detection
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training Pipeline

Run the end-to-end training routine directly from the command line.  Provide
the path to the PaySim dataset CSV file and the pipeline will create a
train/test split, fit the model and export a serialised artefact together with
evaluation metrics.

```bash
python -m src.train data/PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv \
  --model-output models/fraud_model.joblib \
  --metrics-output models/metrics.json
```

Customise the split ratio, random seed or columns to drop using the optional
flags exposed by `python -m src.train --help`.

## Running Tests

Unit tests exercise the data-processing pipeline on a synthetic dataset:

```bash
pytest
```

## Serving Predictions Locally

Once the training step has produced `models/fraud_model.joblib` you can serve
predictions through the included FastAPI application.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Send requests to the `/predict` endpoint with the required transaction fields:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "step": 1,
        "type": "TRANSFER",
        "amount": 1500.0,
        "oldbalanceOrg": 2000.0,
        "newbalanceOrig": 500.0,
        "oldbalanceDest": 0.0,
        "newbalanceDest": 1500.0,
        "isFlaggedFraud": 0
      }'
```

The API also exposes `/health` for readiness checks.

## Container Deployment

A `Dockerfile` is provided for containerised deployments.  Build the image and
run the container after copying the trained model into the `models/` directory:

```bash
docker build -t fraud-detection-service .
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000   -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models fraud-detection-service
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Balance the dataset using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
- For this particular use case, we used undersampling because two reasons.
    1. The minority class had about 8000 rows which is big enough presence.
    2. using SMOTE will generate too much of synthetic data.

### Model Training
- Train a **Neural Network**.
- Use **Grid Search** and **Random Search** for hyperparameter tuning (I used **Manual Search** because it cost less computing resources).
- Adjust the decision threshold to optimize for precision or recall.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the models using metrics like **precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.
- Analyze the **confusion matrix** to understand the trade-off between False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN).

## Results
The final model achieves the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 98%
- **Precision**: 97% (for fraudulent transactions)
- **Recall**: 99% (for fraudulent transactions)
- **F1-Score**: 98% (for fraudulent transactions)
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.997

The confusion matrix shows:

- **True Positives (TP)**: 2444
- **False Positives (FP)**: 88
- **True Negatives (TN)**: 2379
- **False Negatives (FN)**: 17
